# Rahiyaa Project

**Rahiyaa** is a database-driven project built using the MERN stack, designed to provide a responsive and reliable ride-hailing experience. Originally developed as a database course project during our **3rd semester of undergrad in 2024**, it incorporates robust features for both users and admins, utilizing SQL and MongoDB for efficient data management and storage. With role-based access control and a dynamic UI, Rahiya offers an intuitive interface, showcasing our practical understanding of databases within a full-stack application.

## About the Project
Rahiyaa is a web-based ride-hailing application that we developed as a team for our database course project. What started as a focus on database principles has evolved into a full-stack web application, leveraging both SQL and MongoDB to manage and track ride-related data. With separate interfaces for users and admins, Rahiyaa delivers a seamless experience for all, transforming us from mere database students into (almost) full-stack developers. Who knew learning could be this much fun? (i definitely did NOT find it fun when it was mere hours from the deadline)

## Tech Stack
- **Front-end**: React, TailwindCSS, Shadcn (to be integrated), React Router
- **Back-end**: Node.js, Express, MySQL, MongoDB (in combination with MySQL)
- **Additional Tools**: Postman for API testing, npm, Nodemon, Bcrypt, dotenv, React Toastify, Prettier, Axios, CORS, Uniqid, JSON Web Token, AWS MySQL (for database hosting)

---

## Usage
- **User Registration**: Sign up and log in as a passenger or driver.
- **Booking a Ride**: Navigate to the ride booking interface, enter your details, and book a ride.
- **Admin Functions**: Access the admin panel for managing rides and users.

---

## Roadmap
- **Complete Backend Evaluation 1**: Due in two weeks—no pressure, right?
- **Frontend Enhancements**: Implementing Shadcn and TailwindCSS for improved styling and responsiveness.
- **Feature Expansion**: Adding more real-time features for tracking and notifications because who doesn’t love a good notification?

*Well, let’s just say we’ve become honorary full-stack developers along the way. If only we could get a degree for Googling!*
